## Introduction

Ruby on Rails is a powerful web framework that prioritizes convention over configuration and developer productivity. Adhering to best practices ensures that applications are maintainable, scalable, and aligned with community standards. This guide aggregates insights from authoritative sources to provide actionable guidelines for writing idiomatic Rails code and designing robust architectures.

## Code Style

Consistent code style enhances readability and collaboration. The Ruby community emphasizes simplicity and clarity.

- **Use UTF-8 encoding**: Ensures compatibility across systems.
- **Indent with 2 spaces, no tabs**: Aligns with Ruby community standards for readability.
- **Use Unix-style line endings**: Prevents issues in cross-platform development.
- **Keep lines under 80 characters**: Improves readability, especially in code reviews.
- **Remove trailing whitespace**: Keeps code clean and avoids version control noise.

**When to Use**: Always apply these conventions unless a project explicitly adopts a different style guide.
**When Not to Use**: Rarely deviate, but if a legacy project uses tabs or different line lengths, maintain consistency.
**Trade-offs**: Strict adherence improves team collaboration but may require initial setup with linters like RuboCop.

## Development Process

A structured development process ensures high-quality code and maintainable projects.

- **Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before code to ensure functionality and catch regressions.
  - *Example*: Write a test for a user creation feature before implementing the `UsersController`.
  - *When to Use*: Ideal for critical features or complex logic to ensure reliability.
  - *When Not to Use*: May slow down rapid prototyping for non-critical features.
  - *Trade-offs*: TDD increases initial development time but reduces bugs and maintenance costs.
- **Think, Describe, Write Tests, Implement, Refactor**: Plan features, document requirements, test, code, and refine.
  - *When to Use*: For all significant features to ensure clarity and maintainability.
  - *When Not to Use*: May be overkill for simple scripts or one-off tasks.
  - *Trade-offs*: Adds planning overhead but results in cleaner, more maintainable code.

## MVC Best Practices

Rails follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, and adhering to its conventions is crucial.

- **Follow MVC conventions**: Keep logic in its appropriate layer (models for business logic, controllers for request handling, views for presentation).
- **Avoid mixing logic across layers**: Do not place model logic in controllers or view logic in models.
- **Balance "Fat Model, Skinny Controller"**: Move business logic to models, but avoid overly complex models by using service objects or concerns.
  - *When to Use*: When models handle complex business rules or validations.
  - *When Not to Use*: Avoid overloading models with presentation or controller logic; use domain objects for complex logic.
  - *Trade-offs*: Fat models simplify controllers but can become unwieldy; skinny models with service objects improve modularity but add complexity.

## Models

Models handle business logic and data persistence, requiring careful design.

- **Use meaningful names**: Choose clear, descriptive names without abbreviations.
  - *Example*: `UserHistory` instead of `UsrHst`.
  - *When to Use*: Always, to ensure clarity for all developers.
  - *When Not to Use*: Rarely, unless constrained by legacy naming conventions.
  - *Trade-offs*: Descriptive names improve readability but may slightly increase typing.
- **Organize model code**: Structure with sections for relationships, validations, scopes, and methods.
  - *Example*:
    ```ruby
    class User < ApplicationRecord
      # Relationships
      has_many :posts

      # Validations
      validates :name, presence: true

      # Scopes
      scope :active, -> { where(active: true) }

      # Methods
      def full_name
        "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
      end
    ```
  - *When to Use*: In all models to enhance readability and maintainability.
  - *When Not to Use*: May be unnecessary for very simple models with minimal logic.
  - *Trade-offs*: Adds structure but requires discipline to maintain.
- **Use named scopes**: Define reusable queries for common conditions.
  - *Example*: `scope :recent, -> { where('created_at > ?', 1.week.ago) }`
  - *When to Use*: For frequently used queries to reduce duplication.
  - *When Not to Use*: Avoid for one-off queries that don't benefit from reuse.
  - *Trade-offs*: Improves code reuse but can clutter models if overused.
- **Avoid dynamic finders**: Use explicit methods or scopes instead of `find_by_...`.
  - *Example*: Prefer `User.active` over `User.find_by_active(true)`.
  - *When to Use*: When queries need to be explicit and maintainable.
  - *When Not to Use*: Dynamic finders can be convenient for quick prototyping.
  - *Trade-offs*: Explicit methods improve clarity but require more upfront coding.

## Controllers

Controllers should handle HTTP requests and responses, keeping logic minimal.

- **Keep controllers skinny**: Move business logic to models or service objects.
  - *Example*: Use a service object like `CreateUserService` instead of complex logic in `UsersController`.
  - *When to Use*: For all controllers to maintain simplicity.
  - *When Not to Use*: Rarely, but simple CRUD operations may not need service objects.
  - *Trade-offs*: Reduces controller complexity but introduces additional classes.
- **Use strong parameters**: Sanitize inputs to prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities.
  - *Example*: `params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)`
  - *When to Use*: Always for user inputs to ensure security.
  - *When Not to Use*: Not applicable; always use strong parameters.
  - *Trade-offs*: Adds a small layer of code but significantly enhances security.
- **Optimize filters**: Use `before_action` efficiently for common tasks.
  - *Example*: `before_action :set_user, only: [:show, :edit, :update]`
  - *When to Use*: For shared setup or authorization logic.
  - *When Not to Use*: Avoid for action-specific logic that doesn't benefit from reuse.
  - *Trade-offs*: Reduces duplication but can obscure flow if overused.

## Views

Views are for presentation, not logic.

- **Keep views for presentation**: Avoid business logic in views.
  - *Example*: Use helpers for formatting instead of inline calculations.
  - *When to Use*: Always, to maintain separation of concerns.
  - *When Not to Use*: Not applicable; logic belongs elsewhere.
  - *Trade-offs*: Keeps views clean but requires helper or presenter implementation.
- **Use partials**: Reduce duplication with reusable view fragments.
  - *Example*: `<%= render partial: 'shared/form', locals: { model: @user } %>`
  - *When to Use*: For repeated UI elements across views.
  - *When Not to Use*: Avoid for one-off views where partials add complexity.
  - *Trade-offs*: Improves DRYness but can slow rendering if overused.
- **Move complex logic to helpers**: Encapsulate view-related logic in helper modules.
  - *Example*: `UsersHelper#full_name(user)`
  - *When to Use*: For formatting or presentation logic used in multiple views.
  - *When Not to Use*: Avoid for simple, one-off formatting.
  - *Trade-offs*: Enhances reusability but adds maintenance for helper modules.

## Architecture

Advanced architectural patterns improve scalability and maintainability.

- **Use service objects**: Encapsulate complex business logic outside models and controllers.
  - *Example*:
    ```ruby
    # app/services/create_user_service.rb
    class CreateUserService
      def initialize(user_params)
        @user_params = user_params
      end

      def call
        User.create(@user_params)
      end
    end
    ```
  - *When to Use*: For complex operations that don't fit in models or controllers.
  - *When Not to Use*: Avoid for simple CRUD operations that models handle well.
  - *Trade-offs*: Improves modularity but increases the number of classes.
- **Use query objects**: Encapsulate database queries for reusability.
  - *Example*:
    ```ruby
    # app/queries/recent_users_query.rb
    class RecentUsersQuery
      def call
        User.where('created_at > ?', 1.week.ago)
      end
    end
    ```
  - *When to Use*: For complex or reusable queries.
  - *When Not to Use*: Avoid for simple, one-off queries.
  - *Trade-offs*: Enhances testability but adds abstraction.
- **Use form objects**: Manage complex forms with validations.
  - *Example*:
    ```ruby
    # app/forms/user_registration_form.rb
    class UserRegistrationForm
      include ActiveModel::Model
      validates :name, presence: true
    end
    ```
  - *When to Use*: For forms spanning multiple models or complex validations.
  - *When Not to Use*: Avoid for simple forms handled by a single model.
  - *Trade-offs*: Simplifies controller logic but adds new classes.
- **Implement presenter/decorator patterns**: Keep views clean with presentation logic.
  - *Example*: Use the [Draper gem](https://github.com/drapergem/draper) for decorators.
  - *When to Use*: For complex view formatting or logic.
  - *When Not to Use*: Avoid for simple views with minimal logic.
  - *Trade-offs*: Keeps views clean but requires additional setup.
- **Consider event-driven architecture**: Decouple components for scalability.
  - *Example*: Use [rails_event_store](https://github.com/RailsEventStore/rails_event_store) for event handling.
  - *When to Use*: For large-scale applications needing loose coupling.
  - *When Not to Use*: Avoid for small apps where MVC suffices.
  - *Trade-offs*: Enhances scalability but increases complexity.

## Testing

Robust testing ensures code reliability.

- **Write tests for critical paths**: Cover all significant functionality.
  - *Example*: Test user creation with RSpec or Minitest.
  - *When to Use*: For all critical features and edge cases.
  - *When Not to Use*: Avoid testing Rails built-in methods unless their usage is complex.
  - *Trade-offs*: Increases development time but reduces bugs.
- **Use factories over fixtures**: Create dynamic test data with [FactoryBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot).
  - *When to Use*: For flexible, maintainable test data.
  - *When Not to Use*: Fixtures may suffice for static, simple data.
  - *Trade-offs*: Factories are more flexible but require setup.
- **Keep tests fast and isolated**: Avoid database dependencies where possible.
  - *When to Use*: Always, to maintain efficient test suites.
  - *When Not to Use*: Not applicable; slow tests harm productivity.
  - *Trade-offs*: Requires careful design but improves CI/CD speed.

## Performance

Optimize performance to ensure a responsive application.

- **Use eager loading**: Prevent N+1 query issues.
  - *Example*: `User.includes(:posts).all` instead of `User.all` with separate post queries.
  - *When to Use*: For queries involving associations.
  - *When Not to Use*: Avoid for small datasets or unused associations.
  - *Trade-offs*: Reduces queries but may load unnecessary data.
- **Cache where appropriate**: Use Rails caching for expensive operations.
  - *Example*: Cache views with `cache @user do ... end`.
  - *When to Use*: For frequently accessed, stable data.
  - *When Not to Use*: Avoid for rapidly changing data.
  - *Trade-offs*: Improves performance but requires cache invalidation logic.
- **Optimize database queries**: Use indexes and efficient queries.
  - *Example*: Add an index on `users.email` for frequent lookups.
  - *When to Use*: For performance-critical queries.
  - *When Not to Use*: Avoid over-indexing, which can slow writes.
  - *Trade-offs*: Speeds up reads but increases write time and storage.

## Security

Security is critical for protecting user data and application integrity.

- **Prevent SQL injection**: Use parameterized queries or ActiveRecord methods.
  - *Example*: `User.where('email = ?', params[:email])` instead of string interpolation.
  - *When to Use*: Always for queries involving user input.
  - *When Not to Use*: Not applicable; always prioritize security.
  - *Trade-offs*: Minimal overhead for significant security gains.
- **Use authentication/authorization gems**: Leverage [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) and [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan).
  - *When to Use*: For user authentication and role-based access control.
  - *When Not to Use*: Avoid for simple apps without user management.
  - *Trade-offs*: Simplifies security but adds gem dependencies.
- **Keep gems and Rails updated**: Monitor for security patches.
  - *When to Use*: Regularly, to mitigate vulnerabilities.
  - *When Not to Use*: Not applicable; updates are essential.
  - *Trade-offs*: Requires testing but prevents exploits.

## Deployment

Effective deployment practices ensure reliability in production.

- **Use robust deployment tools**: Employ [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano) for automated deployments.
  - *When to Use*: For production deployments requiring consistency.
  - *When Not to Use*: May be overkill for simple, manual deployments.
  - *Trade-offs*: Automates deployment but requires configuration.
- **Monitor performance and errors**: Use tools like [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) or [AppSignal](https://www.appsignal.com/).
  - *When to Use*: In production to track issues and performance.
  - *When Not to Use*: May be unnecessary for small, low-traffic apps.
  - *Trade-offs*: Adds cost but improves reliability.
- **Configure production environment**: Optimize settings in `config/environments/production.rb`.
  - *Example*: Enable caching and asset compilation.
  - *When to Use*: Always for production deployments.
  - *When Not to Use*: Not applicable.
  - *Trade-offs*: Optimizes performance but requires careful configuration.
