## Introduction

Ruby on Rails is a powerful web framework that prioritizes convention over configuration and developer productivity. Adhering to best practices ensures applications are maintainable, scalable, and aligned with community standards. This guide offers detailed recommendations for writing idiomatic Rails code and designing robust architectures.

---

## Code Style

**Consistent code style enhances readability and collaboration.** The Ruby community emphasizes simplicity and clarity.

- **Use UTF- posición encoding**: Ensures compatibility across systems.
- **Indent with 2 spaces, no tabs**: Aligns with Ruby community standards for readability.
- **Use Unix-style line endings**: Prevents issues in cross-platform development.
- **Keep lines under 80 characters**: Improves readability, especially in code reviews.
- **Remove trailing whitespace**: Keeps code clean and avoids version control noise.
- **Prefer single quotes for strings unless interpolation is needed**: Reduces unnecessary syntax.
- **Use safe navigation operator (`&.`) for nil checks**: Prevents `NoMethodError` on nil.
- **Leverage pattern matching (Ruby 2.7+) for clarity in case statements**: Enhances complex conditionals.
- **Adopt RuboCop and StandardRB for automated style enforcement**: Ensures consistency.
- **Document public methods with YARD or RDoc**: Improves codebase discoverability.

**When to Use**: Always apply these conventions unless a project explicitly adopts a different style guide.  
**When Not to Use**: Rarely deviate, but maintain consistency in legacy projects using tabs or different line lengths.  
**Trade-offs**: Strict adherence improves team collaboration but may require initial setup with linters like RuboCop.

---

## Development Process

**A structured development process ensures high-quality code and maintainable projects.**

- **Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before code to ensure functionality and catch regressions.
  - *Example*: Test a user creation feature before implementing `UsersController`.
- **Adopt Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) for user-centric features**: Use RSpec and Cucumber for feature specs.
- **Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for continuous integration**: Automate tests and quality checks on every push.
- **Write clear, atomic commits with descriptive messages**: Facilitates code review and debugging.
- **Use code review tools (e.g., GitHub PRs) and require approvals before merging**: Ensures quality.
- **Automate code formatting and linting in CI pipelines**: Maintains consistency.
- **Think, Describe, Write Tests, Implement, Refactor**: Plan features, document requirements, test, code, and refine.

**When to Use**: For significant features to ensure clarity and maintainability.  
**When Not to Use**: May be overkill for simple scripts or one-off tasks.  
**Trade-offs**: Adds planning overhead but results in cleaner, more reliable code.

---

## MVC Best Practices

**Rails follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, and adhering to its conventions is crucial.**

- **Follow MVC conventions**: Keep logic in its appropriate layer (models for business logic, controllers for request handling, views for presentation).
- **Avoid mixing logic across layers**: Do not place model logic in controllers or view logic in models.
- **Balance "Fat Model, Skinny Controller"**: Move business logic to models, but avoid overly complex models by using service objects or concerns.
- **Use concerns for shared logic**: Extract reusable code into `app/models/concerns` or `app/controllers/concerns`.
- **Leverage ViewComponents or Cells for reusable, testable view logic**: Enhances modularity.
- **Use Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus) for modern, reactive UIs without heavy JavaScript frameworks**: Simplifies dynamic interfaces.

**When to Use**: Always, to maintain Rails’ architectural integrity.  
**When Not to Use**: Not applicable; deviation leads to unmaintainable code.  
**Trade-offs**: Ensures clarity but requires discipline to avoid logic creep.

---

## Models

**Models handle business logic and data persistence, requiring careful design.**

- **Use meaningful names**: Choose clear, descriptive names without abbreviations.
  - *Example*: `UserHistory` instead of `UsrHst`.
- **Organize model code**: Structure with sections for relationships, validations, scopes, and methods.
  - *Example*:
    ```ruby
    class User < ApplicationRecord
      # Relationships
      has_many :posts
      # Validations
      validates :name, presence: true
      # Scopes
      scope :active, -> { where(active: true) }
      # Methods
      def full_name
        "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
      end
    ```
- **Use named scopes**: Define reusable queries for common conditions.
  - *Example*: `scope :recent, -> { where('created_at > ?', 1.week.ago) }`
- **Avoid dynamic finders**: Use explicit methods or scopes instead of `find_by_...`.
  - *Example*: Prefer `User.active` over `User.find_by_active(true)`.
- **Use enums for finite sets of values**: Improves readability and validation.
- **Validate data at both model and database level (with constraints and indexes)**: Ensures data integrity.
- **Use callbacks sparingly**: Prefer explicit service objects for side effects.
- **Leverage ActiveRecord encryption for sensitive attributes (Rails 7+)**: Secures data.
- **Document associations and validations with comments or YARD tags**: Enhances maintainability.

**When to Use**: In all models to enhance readability and reliability.  
**When Not to Use**: May be unnecessary for very simple models with minimal logic.  
**Trade-offs**: Adds structure but requires discipline to maintain.

---

## Controllers

**Controllers should handle HTTP requests and responses, keeping logic minimal.**

- **Keep controllers skinny**: Move business logic to models or service objects.
  - *Example*: Use `CreateUserService` instead of complex logic in `UsersController`.
- **Use strong parameters**: Sanitize inputs to prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities.
  - *Example*: `params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)`
- **Optimize filters**: Use `before_action` efficiently for common tasks.
  - *Example*: `before_action :set_user, only: [:show, :edit, :update]`
- **Respond to multiple formats (HTML, JSON, Turbo Streams) using `respond_to`**: Supports diverse clients.
- **Use rescue_from for error handling and user-friendly error pages**: Improves UX.
- **Paginate large collections with gems like Kaminari or Pagy**: Enhances performance.
- **Use API-only controllers for JSON APIs (Rails API mode)**: Streamlines API development.

**When to Use**: For all controllers to maintain simplicity and security.  
**When Not to Use**: Rarely, but simple CRUD may not need service objects.  
**Trade-offs**: Reduces complexity but introduces additional classes.

---

## Views

**Views are for presentation, not logic.**

- **Keep views for presentation**: Avoid business logic in views.
  - *Example*: Use helpers for formatting instead of inline calculations.
- **Use partials**: Reduce duplication with reusable view fragments.
  - *Example*: `<%= render partial: 'shared/form', locals: { model: @user } %>`
- **Move complex logic to helpers**: Encapsulate view-related logic in helper modules.
  - *Example*: `UsersHelper#full_name(user)`
- **Adopt ViewComponent for reusable, testable UI components**: Improves modularity.
- **Use Turbo Frames and Turbo Streams for dynamic updates**: Enables reactive UIs.
- **Ensure accessibility (a11y) in all views**: Use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and test with screen readers.
- **Leverage I18n for all user-facing text**: Supports internationalization.

**When to Use**: Always, to maintain separation of concerns.  
**When Not to Use**: Not applicable; logic belongs elsewhere.  
**Trade-offs**: Keeps views clean but requires additional helper or component setup.

---

## Architecture

**Advanced architectural patterns improve scalability and maintainability.**

- **Use service objects**: Encapsulate complex business logic outside models and controllers.
  - *Example*:
    ```ruby
    class CreateUserService
      def initialize(user_params)
        @user_params = user_params
      end
      def call
        User.create(@user_params)
      end
    end
    ```
- **Use query objects**: Encapsulate database queries for reusability.
  - *Example*:
    ```ruby
    class RecentUsersQuery
      def call
        User.where('created_at > ?', 1.week.ago)
      end
    end
    ```
- **Use form objects**: Manage complex forms with validations.
  - *Example*:
    ```ruby
    class UserRegistrationForm
      include ActiveModel::Model
      validates :name, presence: true
    end
    ```
- **Implement presenter/decorator patterns**: Keep views clean with presentation logic.
  - *Example*: Use the Draper gem for decorators.
- **Consider event-driven architecture**: Decouple components for scalability.
  - *Example*: Use rails_event_store for event handling.
- **Adopt Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for large, complex domains**: Structures complex logic.
- **Use background jobs (ActiveJob, Sidekiq) for non-blocking tasks**: Improves responsiveness.
- **Leverage dependency injection for testability and flexibility**: Enhances modularity.

**When to Use**: For complex operations or large-scale applications.  
**When Not to Use**: Avoid for simple apps where MVC suffices.  
**Trade-offs**: Enhances scalability but increases complexity.

## Testing

**Robust testing ensures code reliability.**

- **Write tests for critical paths**: Cover all significant functionality.
  - *Example*: Test user creation with RSpec or Minitest.
- **Use factories over fixtures**: Create dynamic test data with FactoryBot.
- **Keep tests fast and isolated**: Avoid database dependencies where possible.
- **Use system tests (Capybara) for end-to-end coverage**: Validates user flows.
- **Test mailers, jobs, and services in isolation**: Ensures component reliability.
- **Use VCR or WebMock for external API calls**: Controls test environment.
- **Measure code coverage with SimpleCov**: Tracks test completeness.

**When to Use**: For all critical features and edge cases.  
**When Not to Use**: Avoid testing Rails built-ins unless usage is complex.  
**Trade-offs**: Increases development time but reduces bugs.

---

## Performance

**Optimize performance to ensure a responsive application.**

- **Use eager loading**: Prevent N+1 query issues.
  - *Example*: `User.includes(:posts).all`
- **Cache where appropriate**: Use Rails caching for expensive operations.
  - *Example*: `cache @user do ... end`
- **Optimize database queries**: Use indexes and efficient queries.
  - *Example*: Index `users.email` for frequent lookups.
- **Profile memory and CPU usage with tools like rack-mini-profiler**: Identifies bottlenecks.
- **Use CDN for static assets**: Speeds up delivery.
- **Compress responses with Rack::Deflater**: Reduces bandwidth.

**When to Use**: For performance-critical areas or large datasets.  
**When Not to Use**: Avoid over-optimization for small apps.  
**Trade-offs**: Improves speed but may require additional setup.

---

## Security

**Security is critical for protecting user data and application integrity.**

- **Prevent SQL injection**: Use parameterized queries or ActiveRecord methods.
  - *Example*: `User.where('email = ?', params[:email])`
- **Use authentication/authorization gems**: Leverage Devise and CanCanCan.
- **Keep gems and Rails updated**: Monitor for security patches.
- **Enforce HTTPS and secure cookies**: Secures data in transit.
- **Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers**: Mitigates XSS.
- **Sanitize user input with Rails helpers (`sanitize`, `strip_tags`)**: Prevents injection.
- **Rotate secrets and credentials regularly**: Reduces exposure risk.

**When to Use**: Always, especially for user input and sensitive features.  
**When Not to Use**: Not applicable; security is non-negotiable.  
**Trade-offs**: Minimal overhead for significant protection.
